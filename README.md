# Background Subtraction using OpenCV-python
Reimplementation of research paper on Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking:

http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/Publications/stauffer_cvpr98_track.pdf
# Overview
Implement background subtraction using following different algorithms:
1. Frame Differencing
2. Mean Filter
3. Median Filter
4. Approximate Median Filter
5. Running Gaussian Average

This is usually done before object tracking algortihms.
